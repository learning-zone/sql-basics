#### Basic Keywords

|Sl.No |Keyword   | Description                                       |
|------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
|  01. |SELECT	  |Used to state which columns to query. Use * for all|
|  02. |FROM 	  |Declares which table/view etc to select from|
|  03. |WHERE	  |Introduces a condition|
|  04. |=	  |Used for comparing a value to a specified input|
|  05. |LIKE	  |Special operator used with the WHERE clause to search for a specific pattern in a column|
|  06. |GROUP BY  |Arranges identical data into groups|
|  07. |HAVING	  |Specifies that only rows where aggregate values meet the specified conditions should be returned. Used because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions|
|  08. |INNER JOIN|Returns all rows where key record of one table is equal to key records of another|
|  09. |LEFT JOIN |Returns all rows from the ‘left’ (1st) table with the matching rows in the right (2nd)|
|  10. |RIGHT JOIN|Returns all rows from the ‘right’ (2nd) table with the matching rows in the left (1st)|
|  11. |FULL OUTER JOIN|Returns rows that match either in the left or right table|


#### Reporting Aggregate functions

In database management, an aggregate function is a function where the values of multiples rows are grouped to form a single value. 

|Sl.No |Function   | Description                                       |
|------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|

|  02. |SUM	   |Accumulate the values|
|  03. |AVG	   |Returns the average for a group of values|
|  04. |MIN	   |Returns the smallest value of the group|
|  05. |MAX	   |Returns the largest value of the group|

#### Using SQL Operators

|Sl.No|Query            | Description                                       |
|-----|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 01. |SELECT c1 FROM t1 UNION [ALL] SELECT c1 FROM t2 |Select column c1 from a table named t1 and column c1 from a table named t2 and combine the rows from these two queries |
| 02. |SELECT c1 FROM t1 INTERSECT SELECT c1 FROM t2 |Select column c1 from a table named t1 and column c1 from a table named t2 and return the intersection of two queries |
| 03. |SELECT c1 FROM t1 MINUS SELECT c1 FROM t2 |Select column c1 from a table named t1 and column c1 from a table named t2 and subtract the 2nd result set from the 1st|

#### Data modification

|Sl.No|Query            | Description                                       |
|-----|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 01. |INSERT INTO t(column_list) VALUES(value_list)|Insert one row into a table named t|
| 02. |INSERT INTO t(column_list) VALUES (value_list), (value_list), … |Insert multiple rows into a table named t|
| 03. |INSERT INTO t1(column_list) SELECT column_list FROM t2 |Insert rows from t2 into a table named t1|
| 04. |UPDATE tSET c1 = new_value	|Update a new value in table t in the column c1 for all rows|

| 06. |DELETE FROM t |Delete all the rows from a table named t|
| 07. |DELETE FROM tWHERE condition	|Delete all rows from that a table named t that match a certain condition|


#### Views

A view is a virtual table that is a result of a query. They can be extremely useful and are often used as a security mechanism, letting users access the data through the view, rather than letting them access the underlying base table:

|Sl.No|Query            | Description                                       |
|-----|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 01. |CREATE VIEW view1 AS SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 WHERE condition|Create a view, comprising of columns c1 and c2 from a table named t1 where a certain condition has been met.|
